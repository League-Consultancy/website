## Light Mode – Improvements

### 1. Issue: Primary CTA lacks dominance in hero section

**Why it's a problem:** Violates visual hierarchy principle. The most important action doesn’t immediately attract attention.
**Suggested improvement:** Increase primary CTA button height to 52–56px, use a saturated brand color, add 8px more padding horizontally, and introduce subtle shadow (0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)).
